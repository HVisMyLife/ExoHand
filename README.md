I have decided few weeks ago, to design and make a prototype of an exoskeleton that would help people with disabilities in their normal functioning.
It was assumed that the designed device will support the rehabilitation of patients after elbow and hand injuries by mechanically "powering" these joints.
The design allows it to be controlled by a button in the palm of your hand, or by pre-programmed sequences of movements. It is also possible to adjust the speed via a potentiometer on the electronics housing.

List of parts:
 12v 775 DC motor,
 MG996R servo motor,
 Blue Pill,
 10k potentiometer,
 H 43A bridge based on half BTS7960 bridges,
 Matrix 4x4 flexible keyboard,
 1.5mm2 cables,
 LiPo 2s 3Ah battery,
 aluminum angle 20mmx10mm,
 racks for elbow gears,
 hoops fixing the exoskeleton to the hand,
 printed elements of the hand mechanism,
 a cotton glove,
 M5 screws,
 M3 screws,
 PlastSpaw PLA 1.75mm filament
